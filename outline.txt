1. Who am I?
	
2. Why am I here?
3. devICT events
4. Kotlin: A short history
	- St Petersburg
	- IntelliJ IDEA
	- 2011
	- 1.0 in February
	- Fully open source
5. TL;DR 
	- This is of interest to:
		- anyone who uses Go, Python, Ruby, Scala, Java
		- Android developers
		- Folks who want to dip their toe into functional concepts in a somewhat familiar space
	- How to learn it
		- try.kotlinlang.org
			- Basic syntax walkthrough
			- Kotlin Koans
		- Kotlin in Action
			- 21 bucks from Manning with '39jemerov' code
		- Udemy - Kotlin Programming: Next Level Java Development
			- Aimed at beginners
			- Half off here: https://www.udemy.com/kotlin-course/?couponCode=AMAZINGREADERS25
6. Pragmatic, Expressive, Concise
7. Pragmatic
	- Strong interop with Java
		- Compiles to Bytecode, can make code literally with only JDK and Kotlin stdlib
			- Small addition to project, 7.5k lines
		- Can call Kotlin directly from Java, and vice versa
		- Can convert Java classes directly to Kotlin (and it works!)
	- Compiles to Java 6 bytecode, effectively porting some Java 8/9 features to Android
		- Lambdas
8. Concise
	- Basic Java Class -> Kotlin One-Liner
		- Watch Svetlana's talk for this
	- Data Class
	- Inferred types
	
	- When
	- To
	- Pair

9. Expressive
	- typealias
	- infix
	- var vs val
	
10. Features
	- Checks for nullability at compile-time, not run-time
		- I work on legacy code and this is my most common exception.
		- Elvis operator
		- ?
		- !!
		- Looks in Java like @nullable and @nonnullable
	- Functional stuff
		- map
		- filter
		- libraries for currying, etc
