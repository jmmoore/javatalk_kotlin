Kotlin: From Russia with... Nice Syntax

01. Who am I?
02. Why am I here?
03. devICT events
04. Kotlin: A short history
	- St Petersburg
		- Kotlin Island
	- IntelliJ IDEA
	- 2011
	- 1.0 in February
	- Fully open source

07. Pragmatic
    - Strong interop with Java
	- Compiles to Bytecode, can make code literally with only JDK and Kotlin stdlib
            - Small addition to project, 7.5k lines
	- Can call Kotlin directly from Java, and vice versa
	- Can convert Java classes directly to Kotlin (and it works!)
        - Uses existing Java libraries as much as possible
            - Collections, for example
    - Compiles to Java 6 bytecode, effectively porting some Java 8/9 features to Android
	- Lambdas
    - Not attempting to reinvent the wheel
        - Focusing on using features that already work in other langs
    - Doesn't force one paradigm
        - Mixing functional and imperative is easy
    - Focus on good tooling
        - As you'd expect from a company that makes IDEs and compilers
        - Kotlin plugin for IDEA is fantastic
08. Concise
	- Basic Java Class -> Kotlin One-Liner
		- Watch Svetlana's talk for this
	- Data Class
            - A lot of boilerplate is made implicit in Kotlin.
	- Inferred types
	- When
	- To
	- Pair
09. Safe
    - Checks for nullability at compile-time, not run-time
	- I work on legacy code and this is my most common exception.
	- Elvis operator
	- ?
	- !!
	- Looks in Java like @nullable and @nonnullable
    - Smart Casts
10. Other Neat Features
    - Functional stuff
	- map
	- filter
	- libraries for currying, etc
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhA-Q7MOre0
    - Built-in DSLs
        - SQL (Exposed)
        - HTML generation
11. What's coming soon?
    - Better interoperability with Java tools
        - Greater Spring support in the IDE
        - Gradle 
    - Greater support for JS runtimes
    - Kotlin scripts (.kts)
12. How to get involved?
    - KEEP
        - github.com/Kotlin/KEEP
        - Kotlin Evolution and Enhancement Process
        - Proposals from JB and Community
        - Feedback and Discussions
    - 
05. TL;DR 
	- This is of interest to:
		- anyone who uses Go, Python, Ruby, Scala, Java
		- Android developers
		- Folks who want to dip their toe into functional concepts in a somewhat familiar space
	- How to learn it
		- try.kotlinlang.org
			- Basic syntax walkthrough
			- Kotlin Koans
		- Kotlin in Action
			- 21 bucks from Manning with '39jemerov' code
		- Udemy - Kotlin Programming: Next Level Java Development
			- Aimed at beginners

06. Who is using Kotlin?
    - JetBrains (obviously)
        - Over 500K lines of Kotlin in production
        - Several new modules of IntelliJ IDEA written fully in Kotlin
    - Basecamp
    - Expedia
    - Netflix
    - Square
    - Google
